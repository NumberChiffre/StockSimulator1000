Hi there! Welcome to StockSimulator1000

1) Open run.html

2) News will show up randomly and will have an impact on the price path (depending on the news content)

3) News are independent and appear on random intervals

4) Each simulation does not contain the same amount of news and some news may or may not reappear

5) Your current position, WVAP, Unrealized P&L and Realized P&L are all displayed on the html file

6) Given that it is a simulation, there are no limits to your current position

7) Shorting is allowed
